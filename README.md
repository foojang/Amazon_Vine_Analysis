**Summary**

For this category of product this is a not a positivity bias in the reviews for the vine program. The paid reviews had a lower percent that were 5 stars then the unpaid. One additional analysis we could do is to look at 4-star reviews. The paid reviews could skew to favor 4 stars, so they do not seem biased but do not want to jeopardize their paid review eligibility by not giving high reviews.

In the above we can see that of the paid 33 percent were 4 stars and on 16 percent were unpaid. We can conclude that the paid reviews are more critical on their reviews and use the range of stars. Where unpaid skew heavy to 5 stars.
